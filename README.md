- This application is made using the mapStruct which is used to convert the Entity classes to the DTO or vice versa is possible.
- This is pure application that is made using the spring boot and spring MVC.
- This application passes all the tests and run properly on the system.
#### New Concepts
- How to Use Mapper for mapping the DTO with the entity class
- How to get Response using the response Entity.
- How to convert the POJO class to the JSON manually using the Jackson class which is `ObjectMapper Class`. We can use this class for converting any class into the JSON using this class and it's also support the jackson binding.
- `@RestController` is the annotation which provides the combination of both which is controller and the Response Body but in controller we are not given the response body.
- `given()` is same as the `when()` just the difference is `when()` syntax uses the realtime objects and given() uses the behavioural Driven syntax.
- I learned about one more concept which is `swagger UI`, which is used for showing the REST API's in the web. It also helps in doing the refactoring of Web API and also help in testing the Web API's also.
- XJC library is used for creating the java coding files from the XML configuration file.
- `Spring RestDocs` plugin is used for creating the documentation for the controllers used in the project of the spring boot.
- `ASCII doctor` maven plugin is used for combine all the final document results into the single documentation that will be provided to us.
- I learned this new concepts that how to generate the documentation using the restdocs template for the constraint that is provided to the variables in the CustomerDTO classes.
- I learned this new concepts that how to update the URI schema like HTTP which is shown in the docs when the documents are being generated. The annotation which is used is `@AutoConfigurableRestDocs` for the configuration to take place in the rest docs.
#### New Dependencies
```angular2html
- MapStruct for mapping classes automatically when the project is building
- H2 Database for storing the data temporary when the application is in the running instance.
- Swagger UI for showing the API in website and for testing API's also.
- XML Jackson dependency for converting the POJO classes to the XML jackson and represent infront of the users.
